WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python solution for a maze traversal problem where:

Language: Python

The main function should be:
def get_number_of_reachable_fields(grid, rows, columns, start_row, start_column)

The function needs to:
1. Take a 2D boolean grid where True means traversable, False means blocked
2. Find how many fields in the top row (row 0) are reachable from the starting position
3. Player can only move up, left, or right (never down)
4. Return an integer counting reachable fields in top row

Include test cases that match the examples provided:
1. 5x3 grid with 3 reachable fields
2. 3x4 grid with 0 reachable fields
3. 5x4 grid with 3 reachable fields
4. 3x1 grid with 1 reachable field

Use a breadth-first search approach to find all reachable positions, keeping track of visited cells to avoid cycles.

The code should include:
- Main function implementation
- Helper function for BFS if needed
- Test cases
- Main block to run tests

Note: The grid is accessed as grid[row][column] where [0][0] is the top-left corner.

Processing command: cd C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\maze && python maze_solver.py

ğŸ¤¡ ğŸ¤¡ ğŸ¤¡ ğŸ¤¡ ğŸ¤¡ 
response: The given Bash command is designed to change the current directory to `C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\maze` and then execute a Python script named `maze_solver.py`. To convert this into a platform-independent Python script, we'll utilize Python's built-in libraries to change directories and execute the script. We'll also make sure to include error handling for directory navigation and script execution. Here's how you can achieve this:

```python
import os
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

def execute_script(script_path):
    try:
        # Ensure the script path exists and is a file
        if not script_path.is_file():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The script {script_path} does not exist.")

        # Change the current working directory
        os.chdir(script_path.parent)
        print(f"Changed directory to: {os.getcwd()}")

        # Execute the script
        result = subprocess.run(['python', script_path.name], capture_output=True, text=True)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Script execution failed with error: {result.stderr}")
        
        print("Script executed successfully!")
        print("Output:\n", result.stdout)

    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(f"File Error: {fnf_error}")
    except PermissionError as perm_error:
        print(f"Permission Error: {perm_error}")
    except RuntimeError as run_error:
        print(f"Runtime Error: {run_error}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

def main():
    # Define the path to the project directory and script
    project_dir = Path("C:/mygit/Slazy/repo/maze")
    script_name = "maze_solver.py"
    script_path = project_dir / script_name

    # Execute the script
    execute_script(script_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Path Handling:** We use `pathlib.Path` to handle paths in a platform-independent way.
2. **Directory Change:** `os.chdir()` is used to change the current working directory to where the script resides.
3. **Script Execution:** We use `subprocess.run()` to execute the script, capturing output for logging and debugging.
4. **Exception Handling:** Various exceptions are handled to ensure robust error messages for different failure scenarios.
5. **Logging:** Informational messages are printed at multiple stages to confirm progress and output.

This Python code replicates the Bash behavior across different platforms while ensuring best practices for error handling and resource management.
