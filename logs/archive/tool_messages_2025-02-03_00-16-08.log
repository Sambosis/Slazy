WriteCodeTool Instructions: Write OpenSCAD code for a mechanical components library. This should include:
1. A module for creating basic washers with parameters
2. A module for creating pins with customizable tolerances
3. A module for creating basic gears
4. Utility functions for common operations

The code should be well-documented with comments explaining the parameters and usage.
Include $fn parameter handling for smooth circles.
Include tolerance parameters that can be adjusted for different printers.
All components should be centered at origin unless specifically offset.

The code should be in OpenSCAD language and focus on parametric design principles.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Write OpenSCAD code for a gear library specifically designed for print-in-place mechanisms. This should include:

1. A module for creating involute spur gears with proper clearances for 3D printing
2. A module for creating planetary gear systems
3. A module for creating rack and pinion mechanisms
4. Helper functions for calculating proper gear ratios and clearances

The code should be in OpenSCAD language and include:
- Detailed parameters for tooth count, module size, pressure angle
- Proper clearances for print-in-place functionality
- Support for different gear configurations
- Comments explaining each parameter and usage
- Include $fn parameter handling for smooth curves
- All gears should be properly centered for easy assembly
- Include calculations for proper gear mesh spacing

Make sure to include proper tolerances and clearances for 3D printing, and focus on making the gears printable without supports.
