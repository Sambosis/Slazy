WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for solving a maze problem where:
- The function should be named get_number_of_reachable_fields
- It takes parameters: grid (2D boolean array), rows, columns, startRow, startColumn
- The player can only move up, left, or right (never down)
- Need to find number of reachable fields in the top row
- Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find all reachable positions
- The grid uses True for traversable spaces and False for blocked spaces
- Include docstring with description and examples

The implementation should:
1. Use a set to track visited positions
2. Use a queue for BFS implementation
3. Track reachable positions in the top row
4. Handle edge cases (invalid input, empty grid, etc.)
5. Include type hints for better code readability

The code should be well-commented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
