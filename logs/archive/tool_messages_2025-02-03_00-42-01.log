WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for maze solver problem. We need to:
1. Create a function GetNumberOfReachableFields that takes a 2D boolean array (grid), number of rows, columns, start row and start column
2. Use BFS to find all reachable positions from the starting point
3. Only allow moves up, left, and right (no down movements)
4. Count how many positions in the top row (row 0) are reachable
5. Return that count

The code should include:
- Collections deque for BFS implementation
- Main function implementation
- Helper functions if needed
- Example test cases
- If __name__ == '__main__' block for testing

The code needs to handle:
- Grid boundaries
- Blocked fields (False/0 in grid)
- Valid moves only (up/left/right)
- Various grid sizes
