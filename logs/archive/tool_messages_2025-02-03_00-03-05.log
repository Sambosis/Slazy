WriteCodeTool Instructions: OpenSCAD code for utility functions and common parameters for 3D printing. This file should include:
1. Common variables for 3D printing tolerances
2. Layer height considerations
3. Utility functions for rounded corners and other common operations
4. Basic geometric helper functions

The code should be well-documented with comments explaining each parameter and function.
This will be used as a base file that other component files will include.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: OpenSCAD code for a parametric print-in-place bearing module. This file should:
1. Include utils.scad
2. Define a bearing module with parameters for:
   - outer diameter
   - inner diameter
   - height
   - number of balls/rollers
   - clearance settings
3. Include proper tolerances for print-in-place functionality
4. Have both ball bearing and roller bearing options
5. Include race groove profiles for smooth operation
6. Comments explaining the design considerations for print-in-place success

The bearing should be designed to print without supports and have proper clearances for FDM printing.
