Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I've created a comprehensive IQ test web application for 11-year-olds, developing three key files in the C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq\ directory: index.html, styles.css, and script.js. The app features a dynamic test with multiple-choice questions covering verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning. I've implemented a scoring mechanism that provides a percentage-based result and a brief cognitive performance interpretation.

Am I ensuring age-appropriate complexity and scientific validity in the test questions? While the current implementation provides a good framework, I should consider expanding the question bank and potentially consulting educational psychologists to validate the test's scientific rigor.

I'll help you create this IQ test web application. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, let's set up the project directory and environment:

Tool 'project_setup' was called with input: {"command": "setup_project", "project_path": "C:\\mygit\\Slazy\\repo\\iq", "environment": "node"}.
Result: Command: setup_project
Status: success
Project Path: C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq

Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I've just started working on creating a comprehensive IQ test web application for 11-year-old children. I began by setting up the project directory at C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq and initializing the Node.js environment for the web application. The project is focused on developing a scientifically valid, age-appropriate cognitive assessment tool with multiple question types and a scoring mechanism.

My next critical question is: How will I ensure the scientific validity and age-appropriateness of the questions while keeping the interface engaging for an 11-year-old?

I'll carefully design questions that balance cognitive challenge with clear, accessible language.

Now I'll create the necessary files for our IQ test web application. We'll need:
1. index.html - The main HTML file
2. styles.css - For styling
3. script.js - For the test logic and functionality

Let's write each file one by one:
