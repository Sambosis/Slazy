WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python script to create an IQ test for an 11-year-old child. The script will:
1. Create two text files: 'iq_test.txt' and 'answer_key.txt'
2. Generate a well-formatted IQ test with different types of questions (verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning)
3. Include multiple-choice options for each question
4. Create a corresponding answer key with explanations

The script should:
- Use string formatting for clean output
- Handle file writing operations
- Include functions to generate different question types
- Format the output with proper spacing and organization
- Use appropriate vocabulary for an 11-year-old
