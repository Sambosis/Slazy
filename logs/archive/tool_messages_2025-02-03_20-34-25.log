WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file containing game settings and constants. The file should include:
- Window dimensions (800x600)
- Colors (BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, etc.)
- Player settings (speed, jump height, gravity)
- Enemy settings (speed, damage)
- Item settings (types of power-ups and their effects)
- File paths for assets (though we won't have actual assets yet)
The constants should be appropriately named and organized.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for the player character class. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Include methods for:
  * initialization with position, size, and basic stats
  * movement (run left/right)
  * jumping with proper gravity physics
  * attacking
  * power-up handling
  * collision detection
  * animation states (idle, running, jumping, attacking)
  * update method for handling state changes
  * draw method for rendering the player
The player should be represented as a colored rectangle for now (we can add sprites later)
Movement should feel smooth and responsive
Include proper physics for jumping (gravity and acceleration)

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for enemy classes. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a base Enemy class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Create specific enemy types (Walker, Jumper, Flyer) that inherit from base Enemy
- Include methods for:
  * initialization with position and enemy type
  * movement patterns specific to each enemy type
  * collision detection with player and environment
  * attack behaviors
  * damage handling
  * death animation/handling
  * update method for AI behavior and state changes
  * draw method for rendering
Each enemy type should have unique behavior patterns:
- Walker: moves left and right, turns at obstacles
- Jumper: jumps periodically, targets player
- Flyer: moves in patterns, can move through platforms
Enemies should be represented as different colored shapes for now

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for game items and power-ups. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a base Item class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Create different power-up types as subclasses:
  * SpeedBoost (increases player speed)
  * JumpBoost (enhances jump height)
  * StarPower (temporary invincibility)
  * FirePower (enables shooting fireballs)
- Include methods for:
  * initialization with position and item type
  * collision detection with player
  * effect application
  * animation (floating/spinning effect)
  * duration tracking for temporary effects
  * update method for animation and state
  * draw method for rendering
Items should be represented as different colored shapes with distinctive appearances:
- SpeedBoost: Yellow triangle
- JumpBoost: Green square
- StarPower: White star shape
- FirePower: Red circle
Include particle effects for when items are collected

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for tracking and managing game statistics. The code should:
- Import json for saving/loading stats
- Create a GameStats class that tracks:
  * Score
  * Coins collected
  * Enemies defeated
  * Power-ups collected
  * Time played
  * Highest jump achieved
  * Distance traveled
  * Deaths/Lives
  * High scores
- Include methods for:
  * Initialization of stats
  * Updating various stats
  * Calculating scoring
  * Saving stats to JSON file
  * Loading stats from JSON file
  * Resetting stats for new game
  * Getting formatted stat strings for display
  * Achievement tracking and unlocking
- Include a separate ScoreBoard class for rendering stats on screen
  * Display current score
  * Display lives remaining
  * Display current power-up status
  * Show time elapsed
  * Display coins collected
The stats should persist between game sessions by saving to a local JSON file.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create the main Python game file that integrates all components. The code should:
- Import required modules:
  * pygame
  * settings
  * player
  * enemies
  * items
  * stats
- Create a Game class that:
  * Initializes pygame and creates the game window
  * Sets up sprite groups for player, enemies, items, platforms
  * Creates instance of Player, GameStats, and ScoreBoard
  * Handles main game loop
  * Processes input events
  * Updates game state
  * Handles collisions
  * Renders all game elements
  * Manages level progression
  * Controls game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- Include methods for:
  * Game initialization
  * Event handling
  * Update game logic
  * Draw/render game
  * Level generation
  * Spawn enemies and items
  * Handle power-up effects
  * Menu system
  * Pause functionality
  * Game over handling
- Main game loop should:
  * Handle events
  * Update game state
  * Draw everything
  * Maintain consistent frame rate (60 FPS)
  * Update display
The game should start in a menu state and respond to keyboard inputs:
- Arrow keys/WASD for movement
- Space for jumping
- Z or J for attacking
- P for pause
- ESC for menu
Include basic platform layout for testing.
