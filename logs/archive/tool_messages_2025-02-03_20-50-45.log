WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file containing game settings and constants. This should include:
- Window dimensions (WIDTH, HEIGHT)
- Colors (BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, etc.)
- Player settings (PLAYER_SPEED, JUMP_SPEED, GRAVITY)
- Game physics constants
- File paths for assets
The code should be well-organized with clear comments.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for the player class using pygame. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Include player attributes (position, speed, state, health, power-ups)
- Implement methods for:
  * movement (left, right)
  * jumping
  * attacking
  * collecting items
  * handling power-ups
  * animation states
- Include collision detection
- Handle sprite animation
The player should move like a classic platformer character with proper physics and animation states.
Include docstrings and comments for clarity.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for enemy classes using pygame. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a base Enemy class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Create specific enemy types (walking enemies, flying enemies, etc.)
- Include enemy attributes (position, speed, health, behavior patterns)
- Implement methods for:
  * movement patterns
  * attack behaviors
  * collision detection
  * animation states
  * death/defeat handling
- Include AI behavior patterns
- Handle sprite animation for different states
Each enemy type should have unique movement patterns and behaviors.
Include docstrings and comments for clarity.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file for game items and power-ups using pygame. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a base Item class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Create specific item types:
  * Coins/Score items
  * Power-up items (speed boost, jump boost, invincibility)
  * Health items
  * Special ability items
- Include methods for:
  * Item animation
  * Collection detection
  * Power-up effects
  * Duration tracking for temporary power-ups
  * Visual effects
- Include item spawn and despawn logic
Each item should have unique effects and visual representations.
Include docstrings and comments for clarity.
