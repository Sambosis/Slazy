WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python script to generate an IQ test for an 11-year-old child.
The script should:
1. Define the test questions, options, and answers in structured data
2. Create a formatted text file containing the test
3. Create a separate answer key file
4. Include different types of questions (verbal, logical, spatial, quantitative)
5. Format the output with clear spacing and numbering

The script should use:
- Basic Python file operations
- String formatting
- List and dictionary data structures

The script will create two files:
1. iq_test.txt - containing the actual test
2. answer_key.txt - containing the answers and explanations

Each question should be properly formatted with:
- Question number
- Question text
- Multiple choice options (labeled a, b, c, etc.)
- Proper spacing between questions
