Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I'm initiating the development of an 11-year-old IQ test web application in the C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq directory. I'll be creating multiple JavaScript and HTML files to construct a comprehensive, scientifically-structured cognitive assessment tool. The project will include modular files for questions, scoring, and interactive web interface, focusing on creating age-appropriate cognitive challenges across verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning domains.

My next critical consideration is: How will I ensure the test's scientific validity and age-appropriate difficulty without making the questions too complex or too simplistic?

Response: I'll carefully calibrate questions using known child cognitive development research and multiple expert reviews.

I'll help you create a comprehensive IQ test web application. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, let's set up the project environment:

Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I just started setting up a project for an 11-year-old IQ test web application in the C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq directory. I initiated a project setup using a Node.js environment, preparing the groundwork for creating a comprehensive, scientifically-valid cognitive assessment tool for children. 

My next immediate focus is to design the detailed structure of the IQ test, ensuring age-appropriate questions across various cognitive domains like verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning.

I'm wondering: How can I ensure the test questions are both challenging and not intimidating for an 11-year-old, balancing scientific rigor with child-friendly engagement?

My quick response is: By carefully crafting questions that use simple language, include visual elements, and progressively increase in difficulty while maintaining clear, supportive instructions.

Now I'll create the necessary files for our IQ test web application. We'll need:
1. index.html - The main HTML file
2. styles.css - For styling
3. script.js - For the application logic

Let's start with creating these files using the write_code tool:
