WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file using Pygame for a side-scrolling platformer game. The code should:
1. Import necessary modules (pygame, os, random)
2. Initialize Pygame and create a game window
3. Set up game constants (screen dimensions, colors, FPS)
4. Create main game loop
5. Handle basic game states (menu, playing, game over)
6. Set up basic input handling
7. Include placeholder functions for loading assets and managing game states

The code should have the following structure:
- Constants for window size, colors, and game settings
- Game class that handles the main game loop and state management
- Basic input handling for keyboard events
- Placeholder for asset loading
- Main game initialization and run function

The game window should be 800x600 pixels and run at 60 FPS.
Include comments for clarity.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python file containing the base sprite classes for the game. The code should:
1. Import pygame and necessary modules
2. Create a base Sprite class that extends pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Include basic sprite properties and methods:
   - Position (x, y)
   - Velocity (dx, dy)
   - Acceleration
   - Animation states
   - Collision detection methods
4. Include methods for:
   - Loading sprite sheets
   - Animation handling
   - Basic physics (gravity, movement)
   - Collision detection
5. Create utility functions for sprite sheet handling

The sprite class should handle:
- Basic physics properties (gravity, friction)
- Animation state management
- Collision detection with platforms and other sprites
- Image loading and animation
Include detailed comments for each method and class.
