Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I've begun working on creating a comprehensive IQ test web application for 11-year-olds in the C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq directory. I'll be creating multiple files including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement an interactive and scientifically-designed cognitive assessment tool. 

My initial focus is on designing age-appropriate questions that cover various cognitive domains like verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning while ensuring the test is engaging and challenging for the target age group.

I'm questioning whether the difficulty level of the questions will be truly appropriate and challenging enough to provide meaningful cognitive insights without being frustratingly complex for 11-year-olds.

A potential solution would be to have the questions peer-reviewed or tested by educational psychologists to validate their appropriateness.

I'll help you create this IQ test web application. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, let's set up the project directory with the necessary structure for a web application.
2. Then we'll create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files needed.
3. Finally, we'll test the application.

Let's start by setting up the project:
