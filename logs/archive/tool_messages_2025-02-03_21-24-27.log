WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python file containing the Player class for a Super Mario-like platformer game. The class should:
- Inherit from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Initialize player with position, size, and properties from settings.py
- Include methods for movement (left, right, jump)
- Handle physics (gravity, collision detection)
- Include power-up status and effects
- Include player states (standing, walking, jumping, attacking)
- Include animation handling
- Track player statistics (coins, score, health)
- Include methods for attacking and taking damage
The code should import necessary pygame modules and settings from settings.py
