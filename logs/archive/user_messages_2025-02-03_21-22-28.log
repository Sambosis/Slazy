create a pygame app that is a classic side scroller game. 
The user should interact with the game with his keyboard.
the main character looks like an italian plummer. 
It should have full features such as jumping, running, and attacking.
There should be enemies that the user can fight and avoid.
He should be able to collect items and use them to get super powers.
It should keep detailed stats of the user's performance.
Your project directory is C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\pygamedemo. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
