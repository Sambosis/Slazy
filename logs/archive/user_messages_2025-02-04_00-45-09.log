You are tasked with creating an IQ test designed specifically for an 11-year-old child. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Test Format and Structure**:
   - The test should consist of 10-15 questions.
   - Include a mix of question types such as:
     - Verbal reasoning (e.g., analogies, vocabulary).
     - Logical and abstract reasoning (e.g., pattern recognition, sequences).
     - Spatial reasoning (e.g., puzzles requiring mental rotation).
     - Quantitative reasoning (e.g., basic arithmetic puzzles or simple problem-solving).
   - Present multiple-choice answers for each question (with 3 to 5 options per question).
   - Clearly number each question.

2. **Content and Difficulty**:
   - Ensure the difficulty is appropriate for an 11-year-old, with questions that challenge but do not overwhelm.
   - The language should be age-appropriate and clear.
   - Questions should stimulate cognitive abilities while being accessible.

3. **Answer Key (Optional)**:
   - Optionally, provide a brief answer key or explanation for each question to facilitate later evaluation.

4. **Output Format**:
   - Output the entire test in plain text.
   - Use clear formatting so that each question, its options, and (if provided) the answer or explanation are easy to read.
   - Separate question sections by appropriate spacing.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - While the final test will be assessed by another AI agent for accuracy and appropriateness, focus solely on generating well-thought-out and engaging questions.
   - Do not include any instructions or hints for the evaluator in the test content.

Write the IQ test accordingly.Your project directory is C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
