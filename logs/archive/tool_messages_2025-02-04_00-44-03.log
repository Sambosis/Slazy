WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script that generates an IQ test for an 11-year-old child. The script should:

1. Define the test content including:
   - 12 questions total (3 from each category: verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning)
   - Multiple choice answers for each question
   - Answer key with explanations

2. Format the output with:
   - Clear question numbering
   - Well-structured multiple choice options
   - Proper spacing between questions
   - Separate sections for the test and answer key

The script should use string formatting and possibly a Question class to organize the content. The output should be both printed to console and written to a file.
