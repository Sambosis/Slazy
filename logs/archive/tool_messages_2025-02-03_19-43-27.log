WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python pygame-based side-scrolling platformer game with the following features:
1. A main character class (Player) that looks like an Italian plumber
2. Enemy class for characters that can be jumped on
3. Platform class for obstacles
4. Item class for collectible power-ups
5. Game class to manage the game state
6. Main game loop with collision detection

The code should include:
- Import pygame and other necessary modules
- Define colors and game constants
- Player class with movement, jumping, and power-up capabilities
- Enemy class with basic movement and death animation
- Platform class for obstacles
- Item class for power-ups (mushroom, star, etc.)
- Game class to manage everything
- Main game loop with event handling
- Basic sprite animations
- Score tracking
- Background scrolling

The game should have:
- Gravity physics
- Collision detection
- Power-up effects
- Score display
- Game over conditions

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script that:
1. Uses PIL (Python Imaging Library) to create basic placeholder sprites
2. Creates an 'assets' directory if it doesn't exist
3. Generates the following images:
   - player.png (32x32 red square with blue overalls)
   - enemy.png (32x32 brown creature)
   - platform.png (64x16 brown block)
   - coin.png (16x16 yellow circle)
   - mushroom.png (16x16 red/white mushroom)
   - star.png (16x16 yellow star)
   - background.png (800x600 sky blue background)

The script should:
- Import necessary modules (os, PIL)
- Create the assets directory
- Define functions to create each type of sprite
- Save all generated images in PNG format
- Use basic shapes and colors to make recognizable game elements
