WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python script to generate an IQ test for an 11-year-old child.
The script should:
1. Define a structured format for questions, including multiple choice options and answers
2. Include different categories of questions (verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning)
3. Format the output clearly with proper spacing and organization
4. Save the test to a text file

The code should include:
- A Question class to structure the questions
- Functions to format and write the test
- A main section with all the test questions
- Clear formatting for output

The test should be saved in two formats:
1. Student version (without answers)
2. Answer key version
