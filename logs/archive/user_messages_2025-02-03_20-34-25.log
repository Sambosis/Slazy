response: To convert the provided Bash command into Python, we need to perform two main actions:

1. Change the current working directory to `C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\pygamedemo`.
2. Install the `pygame` package using pip.

We'll implement each operation with error handling and logging to ensure robustness. The `subprocess` module will be used to execute the pip command, while the `os` and `pathlib` modules will be used to change the directory.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import os
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

def change_directory_and_install_package(directory, package_name):
    try:
        # Resolve the given directory to an absolute path
        target_directory = Path(directory).resolve()
        
        if not target_directory.exists():
            print(f"Error: The directory {target_directory} does not exist.")
            return

        # Change the current working directory to the target directory
        os.chdir(target_directory)
        print(f"Successfully changed directory to {target_directory}")

        # Run pip to install the pygame package
        result = subprocess.run(
            ['pip', 'install', package_name],
            check=True,
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )

        # Print the output of the pip installation
        print(result.stdout)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error during pip install: {e.stderr}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")

# Usage
change_directory_and_install_package('C:\\mygit\\Slazy\\repo\\pygamedemo', 'pygame')
```

### Explanation:
- **Path Validation**: We use `Path(directory).resolve()` from the `pathlib` module to handle path operations, ensuring paths are correctly formed and valid across platforms.
  
- **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block is used to handle exceptions, such as directory change errors or pip installation errors. `CalledProcessError` specifically catches errors from the `subprocess.run` command.

- **Output Capture**: The `subprocess.run` method is used with `capture_output=True` and `text=True` to capture and print the pip command's output and handle any errors.

This code will work on any platform, whether Windows, macOS, or Linux, as long as Python and pip are installed and available in the system's PATH.
