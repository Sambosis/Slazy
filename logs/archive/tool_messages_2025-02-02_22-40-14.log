- Game settings (initial bankroll, betting limits, number of decks)
- Display settings (screen dimensions, colors, fps)
- Training parameters (learning rate, epsilon, gamma)
- Paths for saving/loading models

The code should:
1. Use a Config class to store all settings
2. Include proper type hints
3. Use dataclasses for organization
4. Include documentation for each setting

📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 📎 WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python module for managing cards and deck operations in the blackjack game. Should include:
1. Card class with suit, rank, and value properties
2. Deck class that manages multiple decks of cards
3. Methods for:
   - Shuffling
   - Drawing cards
   - Counting cards
   - Calculating running count and true count
4. Card counting values (+1, 0, -1) based on Hi-Lo system
5. Properties to track remaining cards and deck penetration

The code should:
1. Use proper OOP principles
2. Include type hints
3. Have comprehensive documentation
4. Include card values for blackjack scoring
