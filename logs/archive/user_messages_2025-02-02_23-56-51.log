The final goal is to create a 3d model that can be 3d printed in a print in place fashion that is a fidget toy.  
You should first create resuable parametric modules that can be used and reused to create the final model.
You could have things like gears, hinges, bearings, pins, bolts, springs, washers, nuts etc. that can be used to create the final model.
It should have moving parts with some sort of hinges or bearings that have tight enough tolerances that they are able to function in a interesting way that could be used as a fidget toy.
You need to put a lot of thought into how it will be printed to ensure that it will be functional being printed in place with no supports. 
your write_code tool should be good at writing scad code that can be used to create the final model and the modules. 
You should specify the language you want the code to be in for each file.  If you are going to use python code to create files, do that but specify. If you are asking for openscad code be specific that that is what you expect. Your project directory is C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\scad. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
