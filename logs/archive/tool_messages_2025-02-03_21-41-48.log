WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python main file for a platformer game.
Import statements should be:
import pygame
import sys
from settings import *
from player import Player
from enemies import Enemy, Walker, Jumper, Shooter
from items import Item, PowerUp
from sprites import SpriteSheet
from stats import GameStats

The Game class should be self-contained and not rely on external game.py.
All game states and screen initialization should be done within the Game class.

Game class should initialize:
- pygame
- display surface
- clock
- game states (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER)
- sprite groups
- player
- stats
- camera offset

Include complete implementation with:
1. All game states handled internally
2. Screen and clock created in __init__
3. Proper game loop with event handling
4. State management
5. Drawing and updating all game objects
6. Collision detection
7. Camera movement

The main guard should simply create and run the game instance.
