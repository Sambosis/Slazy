WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the main game file of a side-scrolling platformer using Pygame. This is the entry point of the game.

The code should:
1. Initialize Pygame and create the main game window
2. Set up the game's main loop
3. Import and use classes from other game files (player.py, enemies.py, items.py, level.py)
4. Handle the main game states (menu, playing, game over)
5. Manage the game clock and FPS
6. Initialize the stats tracking system

The window should be 800x600 pixels with a title "Super Plumber Adventure".
The game should run at 60 FPS.
Include proper game state management and scene transitions.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the player class in a side-scrolling platformer using Pygame.

The Player class should include:
1. Sprite initialization and animation states (idle, running, jumping, attacking)
2. Movement mechanics (run left/right, jump with gravity and proper physics)
3. Attack mechanics
4. Power-up system integration
5. Collision detection methods
6. Health/lives system
7. Score tracking
8. State management (normal, powered-up, invincible, etc.)

Key features:
- Player movement using arrow keys or WASD
- Space bar for jumping
- Z or X for attacking
- Proper acceleration and deceleration
- Double jump ability
- Animation state machine for different actions
- Power-up effects (speed boost, higher jump, invincibility)
- Collision rectangles for precise hit detection

Include all necessary Pygame imports and physics constants.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the enemies in a side-scrolling platformer using Pygame.

Create a base Enemy class and several specific enemy types that inherit from it:
1. BaseEnemy class with common functionality:
   - Movement patterns
   - Collision detection
   - Health system
   - Animation handling
   - Basic AI behavior

2. Specific enemy types:
   - Walker (moves left and right, falls off platforms)
   - Jumper (jumps at regular intervals)
   - Flyer (moves in patterns through the air)
   - Boss (larger enemy with special attacks and more health)

Features for each enemy:
- Different movement patterns
- Collision detection with player and environment
- Animation states (walking, attacking, damaged, dying)
- AI behavior patterns
- Damage dealing and taking
- Death effects and scoring
- Spawn points and respawning logic

Include proper physics constants and movement parameters for each enemy type.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the items and power-ups system in a side-scrolling platformer using Pygame.

Create a base Item class and specific item types:
1. BaseItem class with common functionality:
   - Sprite rendering
   - Collection detection
   - Animation effects
   - Basic physics for floating/bouncing

2. Specific item types:
   - Coins (basic collectible for scoring)
   - PowerStar (temporary invincibility)
   - SpeedBoost (temporary speed increase)
   - JumpBoost (enhanced jumping ability)
   - HealthItem (restores player health)
   - ExtraLife (gives additional life)

Features for items:
- Floating animation
- Collision detection with player
- Collection effects (particle effects, sound)
- Power-up duration tracking
- Spawn point system
- Random item generation
- Effect application to player
- Persistent effects tracking

Include proper timing constants for power-up durations and animation speeds.
Add methods for applying and removing effects from the player.

   - Scrolling camera system that follows the player
   - Parallax backgrounds for depth effect
   - Level transitions
   - Checkpoint system
   - Death zones (pits, spikes)
   - Secret areas

3. Level data management:
   - Level loading from JSON/TMX files
   - Tile set management
   - Object placement
   - Enemy patterns
   - Item spawn points
   - Background definition
   - Level progression system

Include methods for:
- Loading level data
- Rendering all layers
- Managing camera position
- Handling collisions
- Spawning enemies and items
- Checkpoint management
- Level completion detection
- Score zone handling
- Secret area detection
