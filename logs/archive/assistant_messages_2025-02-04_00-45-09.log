Here is a quick summary of what I did:
 
I've just started working on creating an IQ test specifically designed for 11-year-old children in the C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\iq directory. I'll be focusing on developing a comprehensive test with multiple question types including verbal, logical, spatial, and quantitative reasoning, ensuring the content is age-appropriate and challenging yet not overwhelming for the target age group.

I'm planning to create a structured test with 10-15 multiple-choice questions that will test various cognitive abilities while keeping the language clear and accessible to an 11-year-old.

Question for myself: How can I ensure the questions are genuinely challenging without being too complex or frustrating for the target age group? 

Brief response: I'll carefully calibrate the difficulty by testing questions against typical 11-year-old cognitive development milestones and cognitive reasoning skills.
