WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code that implements a maze solver function using BFS to find reachable fields in top row.

The main function should be:
def get_number_of_reachable_fields(grid, rows, columns, start_row, start_column)

The function will:
1. Use a queue for BFS traversal
2. Keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles
3. Only allow moves up and sideways (left/right)
4. Count unique reachable fields in the top row

Also include test cases that cover the examples provided in the problem description.

Use collections.deque for efficient queue operations.
