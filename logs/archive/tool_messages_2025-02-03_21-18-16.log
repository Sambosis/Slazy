WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script using Pygame for a side-scrolling platformer game. The main.py file should:
1. Import necessary modules (pygame, sys, os)
2. Initialize pygame and create the main window
3. Set up the game constants (WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, FPS, etc.)
4. Create the main game class with:
   - Game initialization
   - Main game loop
   - Event handling
   - Update game state
   - Render graphics
5. Include proper game states (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER)
6. Set up basic color constants and game configuration

The code should be well-structured and commented. The main game loop should handle basic initialization but leave specific implementations for other modules.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script for the player class in a side-scrolling platformer game. The player.py file should:
1. Import pygame and necessary constants from main.py
2. Create a Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Include player attributes:
   - Position (x, y)
   - Velocity (dx, dy)
   - States (standing, walking, jumping, attacking)
   - Animation frames
   - Power-up status
4. Implement player methods:
   - __init__ for initialization
   - update() for physics and state updates
   - jump() for jumping mechanics
   - move() for horizontal movement
   - attack() for attack mechanics
   - handle_input() for keyboard controls
   - animate() for animation handling
5. Include collision detection methods
6. Power-up handling methods
7. Health and lives system

The player should move smoothly and have proper physics (gravity, acceleration, deceleration).
Include proper documentation and comments.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script for enemy classes in a side-scrolling platformer game. The enemy.py file should:
1. Import pygame and necessary game constants
2. Create a base Enemy class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Include multiple enemy types as subclasses (Walker, Flyer, Jumper)
4. Base Enemy class should have:
   - Position and velocity attributes
   - Health system
   - Basic AI movement patterns
   - Collision detection
   - Animation states
5. Specific enemy types should have:
   Walker:
   - Left-right patrolling behavior
   - Ground collision detection
   Flyer:
   - Flying patterns (sine wave movement)
   - No gravity effect
   Jumper:
   - Jumping mechanics
   - Player tracking
6. Include methods for:
   - __init__ for initialization
   - update() for position and state updates
   - move() for movement patterns
   - attack() for attack patterns
   - take_damage() for handling damage
   - die() for death animation and cleanup
7. Include enemy spawning mechanisms and difficulty scaling

All enemy classes should be well-documented and include proper collision detection with the player and environment.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script for items and power-ups in a side-scrolling platformer game. The items.py file should:
1. Import pygame and necessary game constants
2. Create a base Item class inheriting from pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Create different types of collectible items:
   Coins:
   - Different value coins
   - Collection animation
   - Score tracking
   PowerUps:
   - Speed boost
   - Jump boost
   - Invincibility
   - Fire power
   - Size change
4. Include methods for:
   - __init__ for initialization
   - update() for animation and state
   - collect() for item collection effects
   - apply_effect() for power-up activation
   - remove_effect() for power-up expiration
5. Timer system for power-up duration
6. Visual effects for active power-ups
7. Item spawning system
8. Include proper collision detection with player

Each power-up should have unique effects and visual indicators when active.
Include proper documentation and comments.
