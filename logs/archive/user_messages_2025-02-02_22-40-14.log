1. Core Components:
- Implement a blackjack game engine using Pygame for visualization
- Create a reinforcement learning agent that focuses on bet sizing optimization
- Enforce basic strategy for all playing decisions (hit, stand, double, split)
- Track bankroll and maintain betting statistics

2. Game Logic Requirements:
- The agent must strictly follow basic strategy for all playing decisions
- Implement standard blackjack rules (dealer stands on soft 17, blackjack pays 3:2)
- Track the running count and true count for bet sizing decisions
- Maintain a betting spread based on the count and bankroll

3. Reinforcement Learning Components:
- State space should include: current bankroll, true count, and bet sizing history
- Action space should be a discrete set of possible bet sizes
- Reward function should be based on bankroll changes
- Use Q-learning or SARSA for the learning algorithm
- Implement epsilon-greedy exploration strategy

4. Display and Visualization:
- Show a full game playthrough every 50 games, :
- Update and display training statistics every 10 games, including:
  * Average return per hand
  * Bankroll graph
  * Win/loss ratio
  * Average bet size
  * Maximum drawdown
  * Current learning rate and epsilon value

5. Technical Requirements:
- Use Pygame for the graphical interface
- Implement proper separation of concerns (game logic, RL agent, visualization)
- Include save/load functionality for the trained model
- Add configuration options for:
  * Initial bankroll
  * Betting limits
  * Number of decks
  * Training parameters

Please provide the complete implementation with appropriate comments and documentation.Your project directory is C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\glbj. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.
