WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script using Pygame for a side-scrolling platformer game. This is the main game file that will:
1. Initialize Pygame and create the main game window
2. Import necessary game components from other modules
3. Create the game loop structure
4. Handle main game states (menu, playing, game over)
5. Manage the game clock and FPS

The code should:
- Set up a 800x600 window
- Initialize game states
- Create a basic game loop
- Handle basic event processing
- Import and use classes from player.py, enemies.py, items.py, and game_stats.py
- Include a simple menu system

Use standard Pygame practices for initialization and game loop structure.
Include proper error handling and game exit functionality.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python settings file that contains all the constants and configurations for the game, including:
- Screen dimensions (SCREEN_WIDTH = 800, SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600)
- Tile size (TILE_SIZE = 32)
- Player settings (speed, jump power, gravity)
- Colors
- Game physics constants
The settings should be organized and well-commented.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python class for the player character in a platformer game. The Player class should:
1. Inherit from pygame.sprite.Sprite
2. Initialize with position, size, and appearance (temporary rectangle for now)
3. Include properties for:
   - Movement (velocity, acceleration, direction)
   - State (jumping, running, attacking)
   - Animation states
4. Include methods for:
   - move_left() and move_right()
   - jump()
   - attack()
   - update() with physics and collision detection
   - stop_movement()
   - check_collision() with platforms
The player should have proper physics including gravity, jump mechanics, and smooth movement.
Import necessary constants from settings.py.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python module for enemy characters in the platformer game. The module should include:

1. A base Enemy class inheriting from pygame.sprite.Sprite with:
   - Basic movement and AI behavior
   - Health and damage systems
   - Collision detection with player and environment
   - Update method for behavior and animation

2. Specific enemy types inheriting from base Enemy class:
   - Goomba (basic walking enemy that damages on contact)
   - Koopa (turtle-like enemy that can be jumped on and used as projectile)
   - Flying enemy (moves in a wave pattern)

Each enemy type should have:
   - Unique movement patterns
   - Different health values
   - Specific attack patterns
   - State management (alive, defeated, special states)
   - Collision handling

Import necessary settings from settings.py and include proper physics for movement.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python module for items and power-ups in the platformer game. The module should include:

1. A base Item class inheriting from pygame.sprite.Sprite with:
   - Basic properties (position, sprite, collision rect)
   - Collection detection
   - Animation methods for floating/spinning effects

2. Different types of items:
   - Coin (basic collectible for score)
   - Mushroom (increases player size and health)
   - Star (temporary invincibility)
   - Flower (gives fire power)

3. ItemManager class to handle:
   - Spawning of items
   - Item collection and effects
   - Item animation states
   - Managing active power-ups and their durations

Each item should have:
   - Unique effects when collected
   - Visual feedback
   - Duration tracking for temporary power-ups
   - Proper collision detection
   - Movement patterns (like mushrooms that move along platforms)

Import necessary settings from settings.py and include proper physics for item movement.
