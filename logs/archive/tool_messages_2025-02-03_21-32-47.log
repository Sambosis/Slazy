WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python file containing game settings and constants for a platformer game. Should include:
- Window dimensions (800x600)
- Colors (BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, etc.)
- Player settings (speed, jump height, gravity)
- Game physics constants
- File paths for assets
- FPS setting
The code should be well-commented and organized by category.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python file for sprite and animation handling in a Pygame platformer. The code should:
1. Import pygame and settings
2. Create a base Sprite class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Include animation handling functions:
   - load_sprites() method to load sprite sheets
   - animate() method to handle animation frames
   - update() method for sprite updates
4. Include sprite sheet handling:
   - Method to cut sprite sheets into individual frames
   - Animation state management (idle, running, jumping, attacking)
5. Include collision detection methods
6. Include helper functions for flipping sprites when character changes direction

The code should be object-oriented and well-documented with comments explaining key functionality.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python file for the player character in a Mario-style platformer using Pygame. The code should:
1. Import necessary modules (pygame, sprites.py, settings.py)
2. Create a Player class that inherits from the base Sprite class defined in sprites.py
3. Include player-specific attributes and methods:
   - Movement mechanics (running, acceleration, deceleration)
   - Jumping mechanics with proper physics
   - Attack mechanisms
   - Power-up handling
   - State management (small, big, powered-up states)
   - Health/lives system
4. Include input handling methods:
   - Keyboard controls (left/right movement, jump, attack)
   - Power-up activation
5. Include collision handling:
   - Platform collision
   - Enemy collision
   - Item collection
6. Include player stats tracking:
   - Score
   - Coins collected
   - Power-ups active
   - Time alive
   - Distance traveled

The code should implement proper physics for smooth gameplay and include detailed comments explaining the mechanics.
