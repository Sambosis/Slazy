   - generate_answer_key(): Creates the answer key with explanations

2. Use string formatting to create well-structured output

3. Write two separate files:

   - answer_key.txt: Contains the answers and explanations

4. Include a mix of question types as specified:
   - Verbal reasoning
   - Logical reasoning
   - Spatial reasoning
   - Quantitative reasoning

The code should be well-commented and include error handling for file operations.
