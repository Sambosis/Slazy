WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for game settings and constants. This file will contain all the configuration variables for the game.

The code should define:
- Window dimensions
- Colors
- Player properties (speed, jump strength, etc.)
- Game physics (gravity, friction)
- Paths for assets
- Enemy properties
- Power-up properties
- FPS setting

The code should be well-commented and organized in sections.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for sprite management using Pygame. This file will handle loading and managing game sprites.

The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a SpriteSheet class for handling sprite sheets
- Include functions to load and scale sprites
- Handle animation sequences for player (idle, running, jumping, attacking)
- Handle enemy sprites
- Handle item/power-up sprites
- Include basic sprite transformation functions (flip, rotate, scale)
- Create sprite groups for different game elements

The code should use object-oriented programming and include proper error handling for missing assets.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the player character class using Pygame. This file will handle all player-related functionality.

The code should:
- Import pygame, settings, and sprites modules
- Create a Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Include player state management (standing, walking, jumping, attacking)
- Handle player movement physics (acceleration, deceleration, jumping)
- Include collision detection with platforms, enemies, and items
- Manage power-ups and their effects on the player
- Handle player animations based on state
- Track player stats (health, score, lives, power-ups)
- Include proper hit detection for combat
- Handle player death and respawn
- Include method for saving/loading player progress

The code should use proper object-oriented design with clear methods for each functionality.
Include documentation for each method.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for enemy classes using Pygame. This file will handle different types of enemies and their behaviors.

The code should:
- Import pygame, settings, and sprites modules
- Create a base Enemy class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Create specific enemy types (Walker, Jumper, Flyer) inheriting from base Enemy
- Include enemy AI behaviors (patrolling, chasing player, attacking)
- Handle enemy movement and physics
- Include collision detection with player and environment
- Manage enemy animations based on state
- Handle enemy death and item drops
- Include enemy spawning logic
- Handle different difficulty levels
- Include enemy stats (health, damage, speed)

Each enemy type should have unique behaviors and characteristics.
Include proper documentation for each class and method.
Use object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

- Create specific item types:
  * Coins (for scoring)
  * Health power-ups
  * Speed boost items
  * Jump boost items
  * Attack power-ups
  * Temporary invincibility items
- Include item behavior (floating, spinning, glowing effects)
- Handle item collection and effects application
- Include timed power-up duration management
- Handle item spawning logic
- Include particle effects for item collection
- Manage item animations
- Include sound effect triggers

Each item should have unique properties and effects on the player.
Include proper documentation for each class and method.
Use object-oriented principles and include appropriate error handling.
