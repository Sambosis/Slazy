WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code that implements a maze traversal solution using BFS. The code should include:

1. Main function GetNumberOfReachableFields that takes:
   - grid: List[List[bool]] - 2D array where True means traversable, False means blocked
   - rows: int - number of rows in grid
   - columns: int - number of columns in grid
   - startRow: int - starting row position
   - startColumn: int - starting column position

2. The function should use BFS to find all reachable fields in the top row (row 0)
   - Player can only move up, left, or right (not down)
   - Can't move to blocked fields (False in grid)
   - Should track visited positions to avoid cycles

3. Include test cases demonstrating the examples from the problem description

The code should be well-commented and handle edge cases appropriately.
