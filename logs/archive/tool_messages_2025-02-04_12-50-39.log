WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Flask application (app.py) that will serve an IQ test web application. The application should:
1. Import necessary Flask modules
2. Create a Flask instance
3. Define a route for the main page that renders the index.html template
4. Include configuration for running the app in debug mode

The code should be structured as follows:
- Import statements at the top
- Flask app initialization
- Route definitions
- Main execution block with debug mode enabled

The application will serve static files from the /static directory and templates from the /templates directory.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a single HTML file that contains a complete IQ test web application for 11-year-olds. The file should include:

1. HTML Structure:
   - Header with title and instructions
   - Container for questions
   - Results section
   - Progress indicator
   - Start and submit buttons

2. CSS (in style tag):
   - Clean, kid-friendly design
   - Responsive layout
   - Clear question presentation
   - Proper spacing and formatting

3. JavaScript (in script tag):
   - Array of 15 test questions covering:
     * Verbal reasoning (analogies, vocabulary)
     * Logical reasoning (patterns, sequences)
     * Spatial reasoning (mental rotation)
     * Quantitative reasoning (math puzzles)
   - Functions for:
     * Starting the test
     * Displaying questions
     * Handling answers
     * Calculating scores
     * Showing results
   - Question randomization
   - Timer functionality
   - Score calculation based on correct answers

Questions should be age-appropriate for 11-year-olds but challenging enough to provide meaningful cognitive assessment.
