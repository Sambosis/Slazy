- Window dimensions
- Colors
- Player settings (speed, jump power, etc.)
- Game physics (gravity, friction)

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Player class for a platformer game using Pygame. The code should:
- Import pygame and settings
- Create a Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Include player attributes (position, velocity, state)
- Implement movement methods (run, jump, attack)
- Handle power-up states
- Include animation states
- Handle collision detection
- Update method for player physics
- Draw method for rendering
The player should behave like a classic platformer character (Mario-style).
Include proper physics for jumping and movement.
Language: Python
