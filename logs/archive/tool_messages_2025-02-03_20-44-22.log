WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python script using Pygame for a side-scrolling platformer game. The main game file should:
1. Initialize Pygame and create the main window
2. Set up the game loop
3. Handle basic event processing
4. Import and use player, enemy, items, and stats modules
5. Implement the main game logic

The code should:
- Set up a 800x600 window
- Create a game clock
- Handle keyboard events
- Implement basic game states (MENU, PLAYING, GAME_OVER)
- Include placeholder functions for loading assets
- Include basic color definitions and game constants
- Import all necessary modules

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create a Python class for the player character in a side-scrolling platformer game. The player should be an Italian plumber-like character with the following features:

1. Player class should include:
- Movement mechanics (running left/right)
- Jumping mechanics with proper physics
- Attack abilities
- Power-up status tracking
- Animation states
- Collision detection
- Health/lives system

2. The code should include:
- Player sprite handling
- Movement speed constants
- Jump force and gravity physics
- State management (standing, running, jumping, attacking)
- Power-up effects
- Health and lives tracking
- Collision rectangle updates
- Animation frame management

Import necessary pygame modules and define required constants for player movement, animation, and physics.
