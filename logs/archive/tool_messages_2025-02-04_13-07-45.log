WriteCodeTool Instructions: Create an HTML file for an IQ test web application. The file should include:
- Proper HTML5 structure
- Links to styles.css and script.js
- A container for the test content
- A welcome screen section
- A question container section that will show one question at a time
- A results section that will be shown at the end
- Navigation buttons (Start, Next, Submit)
- Progress indicator
The structure should be clean and semantic, using appropriate HTML5 elements.
The file should support the JavaScript functionality that will be added later.
