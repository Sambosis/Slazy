I need you to review the repo located at https://github.com/sambosis/BLazy 
It's main entry point is a file named loop_live.py

It calls an LLM in an agentic manner to complete a task.

You should create a more advanced Jupyter Notebook that can be used to showcase more of it's full capabilites.
This will largely be  making calls to the tools located in the tools directory.
The notebook should both contain everything that is needed including any package installs or git operations that will be needed to run them.Your project directory is C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\blazie1. You need to make sure that all files you create and work you do is done in that directory.

response: The given Bash command navigates to a specific directory and opens a Jupyter Notebook file. In Python, we'll achieve this functionality by using the `os` module to change directories and the `subprocess` module to launch the Jupyter Notebook. We'll ensure the Python code is platform-independent, incorporate proper error handling, and utilize best practices:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import logging
from pathlib import Path

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def open_jupyter_notebook(directory: Path, notebook_name: str):
    """
    Opens a Jupyter notebook file in the specified directory.

    :param directory: Path to the target directory
    :param notebook_name: Name of the Jupyter notebook file to be opened
    """
    try:
        # Validate that the directory exists
        if not directory.exists() or not directory.is_dir():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The directory '{directory}' does not exist.")

        # Construct the notebook path
        notebook_path = directory / notebook_name
        
        # Validate that the notebook file exists
        if not notebook_path.exists() or not notebook_path.is_file():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The notebook '{notebook_name}' does not exist in '{directory}'.")

        # Change to the target directory
        os.chdir(directory)
        
        # Open the Jupyter notebook
        logging.info(f"Opening Jupyter notebook '{notebook_name}' in directory '{directory}'.")
        subprocess.run(['jupyter', 'notebook', notebook_name], check=True)

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logging.error(e)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open Jupyter Notebook: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    project_directory = Path("C:/mygit/BLazy/repo/blazie1")
    notebook_filename = "BLazy_Demo.ipynb"

    open_jupyter_notebook(project_directory, notebook_filename)
```

### Explanation

1. **Path and Logging**: It uses `pathlib.Path` for handling file paths, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems. `logging` is utilized to provide logs for better debugging and error messages.

2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Checks if the specified directory exists.
   - Checks if the specified Jupyter Notebook exists.
   - Uses exception handling to capture `FileNotFoundError`, subprocess errors, and any unforeseen errors.

3. **Subprocess**: The `subprocess.run()` method is used to launch the Jupyter Notebook. The parameter `check=True` is used to raise an error if the command execution fails.

This code setup provides comprehensive error handling and logging, ensuring robustness and maintainability.
