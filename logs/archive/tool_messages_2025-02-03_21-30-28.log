WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the main game file using Pygame. The code should:
1. Import required modules (pygame, sys, os)
2. Initialize pygame and create the main game window
3. Set up game constants like screen dimensions, colors, and FPS
4. Create the main game loop structure
5. Handle basic event processing
6. Include game states (MENU, PLAYING, GAME_OVER)
7. Set up the basic game class that will manage the game state

The code should be structured as follows:
- Constants and configurations at the top
- Game class definition with init method
- Main game loop with state management
- Event handling
- Update and render methods
- Main execution block

The window should be 800x600 pixels and run at 60 FPS.

WriteCodeTool Instructions: Python code for the player class using Pygame. This class should handle the main character (italian plumber) functionality:

1. Import required modules (pygame, math)
2. Define the Player class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite
3. Include player attributes:
   - position (x, y)
   - velocity
   - acceleration
   - jumping state
   - running state
   - power-up state
   - health
   - current animation frame
4. Include methods for:
   - movement (left, right)
   - jumping
   - attacking
   - collecting power-ups
   - animation handling
   - collision detection
   - updating player state
5. Include player statistics tracking:
   - coins collected
   - enemies defeated
   - distance traveled
   - power-ups collected
   - time alive

The player should have proper physics for jumping and movement, including gravity and acceleration.
Include states for different power-ups (e.g., super size, invincibility, fire power).
Movement should feel smooth and responsive.
