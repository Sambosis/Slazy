The game includes interactive keyboard controls, enemy encounters, platforms, collectible items for super powers, and three levels of increasing difficulty. The project was specified to reside in the directory C:\mygit\Slazy\repo\pygamedemo and includes features such as level progression and detailed player performance stats.</p>
